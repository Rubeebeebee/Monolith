# Conflict Rule 1
## Avoid random deathmatch (RDM).

Players must have valid in-character reasons to kill or attack another player.

- [color=red][bold]Random, unprovoked attacks or killings (RDM) are not allowed.[/bold][/color]
- Always prioritize [color=yellow]non-lethal conflict[/color] and [color=green]roleplay escalation[/color].
- Combat should arise naturally through roleplay, with proper escalation and meaningful interaction.
- [color=yellow]Non-lethal options[/color] (such as capturing, negotiating, or detaining) are strongly encouraged to foster deeper storylines.

[italic][color=yellow]Faction Conflict:[/color][/italic]  
- Some factions are in a state of open war (e.g. [color=yellow]TSFMC[/color], [color=yellow]USSP[/color], [color=yellow]Rogue[/color]). These conflicts do not require full escalation, but [color=green]some roleplay context or tension[/color] must still occur before initiating lethal combat.  
- Avoid treating open war as a license for random killing â€” [color=green]intent, atmosphere, and narrative buildup[/color] still matter.

[italic][color=green]Conflict should be meaningful, escalate naturally, and prioritize roleplay over random violence.[/color][/italic]
